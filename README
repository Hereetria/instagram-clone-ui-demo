# InstagramJr_Project_Design_Demo

## Description
This project was developed to model the design phases of a social media application by mimicking the design of the Instagram app.

## Installation
After cloning the project, it is enough to install a server and run it through the server (I used Lite Server). All the files are already prepared and located in the `dist` folder.
If you want to make any additions, my TypeScript files are located in the `src` folder. The files in the `shared` folder represent the exported code,
while the files in the `modules` folder are the corresponding files that are imported and used in the project.

## Features
All the features available on the main page of Instagram can be used here as well. Currently, only the `mainstream` and `seeAll` pages are available.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

## Contributions to Me
I initially started this project to improve my design skills and learn Bootstrap. I completed this goal quickly, and when I was still in the early stages of the project,
I shifted my focus to learning JavaScript and later building a modular structure with TypeScript. After achieving my goals for the project,
I decided to move on to React instead of completing the other pages. I will soon share the completed version of this project with React and Material UI.
